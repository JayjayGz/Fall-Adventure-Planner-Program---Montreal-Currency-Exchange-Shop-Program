//This program allows the user to sell foreign currency by calculating the required amount to spend in the target currency in order to receive a specific amount of CAD. The opposite is also possible. In other words, the user can also buy foreign currency by calculating the amount of CAD necessary to receive a specific amount of target currency. The program uses the concepts of "if" statements and "switches" to adapt the situation to the type of transaction (buy or sell) and to the buy rates and sale rates with respect to their currencies.
